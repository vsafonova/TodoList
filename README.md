# Taskify app

Web app for managing a TODO list.

## Project brief
<p>
  Build an API that is connected to a database using API design principles such as REST.
</p>
<p>
  The only requirement is that the backend should be a Node.js service with persistent storage (Database). 
  The front end should be a simple web app that interacts with said backend.
</p>
<ul>The app has the following functionalities:
  <li>User Registration</li>
  <li>User authentication</li>
  <li>CRUD operations for tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We were provided with a PostgreSQL database endpoint and credentials.
</p>
<p>
  We used acquired knowledge around GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests to interact with the backend, following RESTful principles
</p>
